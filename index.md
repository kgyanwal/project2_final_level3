                                                                                By:- Krishana Gyanwali & Sudesh Subedi

### Intial Idea: Rationale
*The initial idea was generated after discussing some issues which could help the users to understand the scenario by immersing into environment. We wanted to create a forest management to save wild animals refering to the California wildfire. The year 2020 is not only began with Coronavirus, but also the wild fires which killed millions of animals in Australia and West coast of the United states. We wanted to create a forest which has not tree in between and shallow lakes which animals can easily cross the water to reach the sandy island. The concept of sandy island came into the picture because it would not burn by the fire or its flame. The objects in the island should not be distroyed by the fire. We wanted to give the message to the world through the players that it is the responsibily of the humans to protect the wild animals. Wildfire is not always created by humans necessarily, sometime lightening and some frictions in the atmosphere generates the fire especially in the summer season. We have drafted the blueprint. But, we were not able to portray everything in the short span of time. 

* To ease the development work, the plan proceeded with designing the three different layers using Unity's open source and freely avaialable 3D gamekit. Each layer is explained below for the relevancey of the game design. 

### Challenges: 
It is impossible to create all these complex structures, environments and animals in a short peroid of time. So, we drifted from the aboriginal idea, however, hypthetically (like sci fi movie or anything could be possible kinda approach) we limit ourselves withthe periphery of the orignail idea. But, the actual development of this game project took us into a direction where we learned a lot about Unity, C sharp language and more importantly the 3D GAME Kit built by unity, sophisticated gaming platform.  

### Game Development

We have three layers in the game. The first layer is a simple layer in which some enmies block the saver (Ellen, the protagonist of Unity 3d Gamekit) to cross to the next level. The instruction is simple enough that Ellen has to find out the switch and jump the door or cross the door to go to the next level. The instruction pops up unannoningly on the scene during the time of the game. The second layer is more complecated and there are lots of enemies added and some of them are very powerful. The saver has to work hard to kill all the invaders, and then he has to cross the bridge and open the door to go the next level, which means he saved the animals from those fireball throwing envaders. 

Technically, it is depended on the UI design of multiple 3d platforms available in unity. The first two layers are dependent on 3D Gamekit as mentioned above. The layer 3 is dependent on Terrain tools-Fantasy land, animals prefabs (which we purchased from unity) and skybox for sky bluish color. We manually created a terrain, added a wide pathway, the wide pathway is created because the intention is to cut off the fire from spreading to the next zone.  

## Level 1st

As the picture below shows that we named our team as team 10: the saver, the main character in the game, Ellen. At first, the Ellen is hidden into the ground. It was created like that because we planned to use warning noise of wildfire to wake up the character. However, it became so complex to create waving sound like the tornado warning and horrific atmosphares. We scapped our project three times because it was breaking in some transition and the machine took so much time to process the data. So, we moved toward a simple game in which Ellen has to discover the switch to go to the next level. Around the swich area, enemies are added to prevent the character to enter into the territory.

Technical description: The whole game is created manually using Unity 3D game kit. Initially the terrain is created, then the 3D vegetation is added. We wanted to make island to same animals, so we created water around the surface. When Ellen sees the swich, she moves towards that direction, the enemies attack. We gave higher endurance number to the main character and one time hit to the enemies. So, Ellen has to kill the enemies to go to the next level. The spitter glues the character and run away. Ellen has to follow and kill it to ease the transition to the next level. Once the Ellen jumps over the door, the next level will start.
